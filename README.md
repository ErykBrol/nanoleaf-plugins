# nanoleaf-plugins
Plugins written for the Nanoleaf lighting panels for use with the Rhythm module which allows for the panels to synchronize to sounds/music in the room.


## Patterned Beats
Patterned Beats reacts to the beat in order to change color and uses sound frequency to determine what color in the palette it will change to. Using the idea of a background/foreground pattern, the resulting visual effect is a pseudorandom array of panels lighting up in an active color and the rest in a neutral background color.

## Soft Lightning
Soft Lightning uses sound frequency to determine the background color of the panels, and used the speed of the beat in the music to determine the speed of a "lightning flash" which shoots across the layout. This creates an atmospheric effect where the color matches the mood of the music and the lightning flashes add subtle pops of excitement.
